		<h1>More Than A Dream Less Than A Reality</h1><br/>
		<p>I dreamt of wisps of grey dancing in the morning sun,</p>
		<p>the rustle of restless trees, swaying,</p>
		<p>the soft, moist earth waiting to be home to withered leaves,</p>
		<p>the crunch of naked, excited footsteps on this forlorn, forgotten path,</p>
		<p>leading onto a blue infinity.</p>
		<p>It was me,</p>
		<p>I was walking further and further away,</p>
		<p>towards the sea, away from land.</p>
		<p>I undressed myself, and</p>
		<p>as I was about to jump in,</p>
		<p>I halted when the water sizzled white coming in contact with my feet.</p>
		<p>A comforting, yellow warmth peaked out of the clouds,</p>
		<p>and when I looked down at the distorted, construed reflections,</p>
		<p>a tumultuous sound escaped my mouth.</p>
		<p>I realised I was truly lost,</p>
		<p>I always had been. </p>
