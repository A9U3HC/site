		<h1>Hoping To Get By</h1><br/>
		<br/><p>the future is beautifully broken</p>
		<p>Fate is drinking wine</p>
		<p>we're dreamin'</p>
		<p>we're fallin'</p>
		<p>we're crawlin'</p>
		<p>we're just hopin’ to get by</p>
		<br/><p>the dreams they sometimes crumble</p>
		<p>the path is not always right</p>
		<p>we can be more</p>
		<p>we can be less</p>
		<p>that's for us to decide</p>
		<br/><p>every step I'm takin'</p>
		<p>every heart thats breakin'</p>
		<p>sorrow has been too kind</p>
		<p>the world's turnin'</p>
		<p>hearts are beatin'</p>
		<p>we're alive</p>
		<p>we're alive</p>
		<br/><p>we're runnin’</p>
		<p>we're stumblin'</p>
		<p>we're fallin'</p>
		<p>we're just hopin’ to get by</p>
		<br/><p>don't fly too high</p>
		<p>in this dogfight</p>
		<p>you'll get shot down</p>
		<p>it'll take your life</p>
		<p>I'm comin'</p>
		<p>you're coming'</p>
		<p>we're comin'</p>
		<p>we're all comin' home tonight</p>
		<br/><p>oh … we're runnin’</p>
		<p>we're stumblin'</p>
		<p>we're fallin'</p>
		<p>we're just hopin’ to get by</p>
		<br/><p>i got this feeling</p>
		<p>like its the end of the world</p>
		<p>like empty pockets of the poor</p>
		<p>like hunger feeding off our hope</p>
		<p>its the end of the world and there's nowhere to run</p>
		<p>hope has drowned in the tsunami to come</p>
		<br/><p>let's return to our homes and wait for the end</p>
		<p>wait for the people to take one last breath</p>
		<p>wait for the television to be left unattended</p>
		<p>wait for the Man to come and take us away</p>
		<p>and that’s the end of my world</p>
		<br/><p>foolish me</p>
		<p>foolish you</p>
		<p>you took me seriously</p>
		<p>you took my words to be true</p>
		<p>it was just a feeling and not the end of the world</p>
		<p>i was just trying, hoping to get by.</p>
		<br/><p>we're runnin’</p>
		<p>we're stumblin'</p>
		<p>we're fallin'</p>
		<p>we're just hopin’ to get by</p>
