		<h1>Man And Bear</h1><br/>
		<p>In the woods, under the shade of great oak trees,</p>
		<p>where the smell of dew intoxicated the air,</p>
		<p>Man and Bear stood still, entrapped in time.</p>
		<p>They peered into each other with a lonely, stark silence,</p>
		<p>and their eyes told of a story, the only story there is, the story of life.</p>
		<p>He realised he had found his home, in the borderlands, under the open night sky.</p>
		<p>Many moons passed until the heavens thundered, the wind howled, and slowly the rain came.</p>
		<p>But they were unmoved by the flooding of the great Missouri,</p>
		<p>they were calm and content, in the eye of the storm.</p>
		<p>And as Nature wreaked havoc, the Bear inside him slept</p>
