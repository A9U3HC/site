		<h1>Run with the Wind, until it stops</h1><br/>
		<p>Kakeru woke up to the sound of birds chirping and the gentle rustle of leaves. It was summer alright. His time at Kansei University was coming to an end. For the first time in a long time, he felt confident in himself and his ability to overcome any upcoming challenges. He suddenly felt a heavy force on his back and he was sent flying off the porch on the ground outside. The smell of the morning dew filled his nostrils and he was just a bit annoyed. He looked up and saw Musa sprawled across the floor, spilling out of his mattress due to his natural height. He was snoring, hard. Kakeru wanted to walk up to him and slap him in the face. That's what he would usually do. But something was different today.</p>
		<br/><p>Coach Genichiro was quietly sitting nearby on the porch sipping his tea. He was doing his usual mix of observing, chuckling, and coughing in different combinations. He shakes his head and thinks to himself, "I should honestly have retired 15 years ago.‚Äù</p>
		<br/><p>But there were more athletes to be trained. More men to be made. It seemed like Haiji's attitude had rubbed off on him. Haiji, a Kansei university graduate, was now the assistant coach of Kansei University's track team. They never liked to admit it but Haiji was more of a coach than Old Man Genichiro. He was old. No one knew how old he was but he was old enough. In his prime, he'd run for Japan's team. This 5"6 runner was a giant back in the day. Now he had shrunk to a frail 5"3. He still commanded the respect he deserved. It was gonna be another hot summer his year. He was interested to see what this year would bring.</p>
