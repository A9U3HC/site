		<h1>Scope of Work</h1><br/>
		<p>Water logging is a well known and extremely prevalent problem in India. I wanted to know why progress has not been made in this field. I asked my grandmother.</p>
		<br/><p>> A is me, D is my grandmother aka `dadi`.</p>
		<br/><p>A: Do we have rainwater drains in our street?</p>
		<br/><p>D: No. One of the people in our lane used to work for the government and what he did was make a drain and connected it to the sewage line. So every time it rains, the end of the lane would smell like shit.</p>
		<br/><p>A: Why is this still a problem?</p>
		<br/><p>D: In India, only 30% of people pay taxes. When the government plans something, they do not have the funds to do long term work. Obviously there is some misuse of funds. That is everywhere.</p>
		<br/><p>A: I can see why they only plan for the next 1 to 5 years. Once their party goes out of power, they do not want another party—</p>
		<br/><p>D: See, that is always there but I think majorly it is a funding issue. Whatever money you have do the work righ—</p>
		<br/><p>A: So reduce the scope of work. If you have some amount of money and you know you do not have the ability to make big changes, reduce the scope of work.</p>
		<br/><p>D: That is a really good way of thinking.</p>
		<br/><p>Reducing the scope of work reduces time and money taken, improves the quality of work and builds goodwill amongst people. It is better to have a history of many small successful projects rather than few large mediocre ones.</p>
