		<p>To get better at software development, learn something new. Force yourself to learn something new every epoch. Give yourself time to internalize it. Learn something more and build on top of it. Building more complex projects with larger feature sets will give you confidence in your ability to build and internalise complex systems in your head. And once you reach your mental limit, you will start to write code which is well named, documented and easily testable. You realise that your memory is not good enough. </p>
