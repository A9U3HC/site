		<h1>A Bus Ride Or A Dream... I Can't Remember</h1><br/>
		<p>The bus driver was high, high as a kite.</p>
		<p>He was fat too and his eyes were glazed over just like a dead man’s.</p>
		<p>He held the gear stick in one hand and daaru [alcohol] bottle in another.</p>
		<p>As he changed the gear, he took a few gulps.</p>
		<p>*Glug!*</p>
		<p>*Glug!*</p>
		<p>*Glug!*</p>
		<p>I watched in horrid fascination and thought,</p>
		<p>maybe I’ll die today, then again, maybe not.</p>
		<p>The bus ride was long. It was hot, sticky and stinky.</p>
		<p>I looked around and I thought, no one cares.</p>
		<p>The driver was drinking and smoking himself to death.</p>
		<p>And no one cared. Even I didn’t.</p>
		<p>I saw his face through the rear view mirror,</p>
		<p>and my stomach lurched.</p>
		<p>I saw dry, red insomnia ridden eyeballs</p>
		<p>straining against the twelve o’clock afternoon sun,</p>
		<p>colourless parched skin,</p>
		<p>and a ghost of a man.</p>
		<p>Being high as a kite and all,</p>
		<p>he, unfortunately, saw nothing but a mix of yellow and white with hints of red and green.</p>
		<p>The yellow was slowly fading away and then there was only white.</p>
		<p>The bus banged into a car and everything went black.</p>
		<p>I was thrown in front.</p>
		<p>I was only eleven years old then.</p>
		<p>I was numb all over, and it hurt too.</p>
		<p>My mouth was bitter, I had bitten my tongue.</p>
		<p>As I straightened myself up avoiding the bodies I thought, blood tastes weird.</p>
		<p>Then I spat some out.</p>
		<p>I inhaled some diesel and vomited.</p>
		<p>Someone grabbed me by the arm and flung me out of the bus.</p>
		<p>I hit the road hard, and it hurt like hell.</p>
		<p>I had dislocated my shoulder.</p>
		<p>He had dislocated my shoulder.</p>
		<p>The bus driver rested his face on the steering wheel and looked at me.</p>
		<p>He probably didn’t want me dirtying the floor.</p>
		<p>He kept on staring. I realised he was dead.</p>
		<p>What a damn shame I thought.</p>
