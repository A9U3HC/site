		<h1>Visual Appeal</h1><br/>
		<p>While I was walking down my lane towards my house, I saw a gardener cutting the leaves of a hedge. He</p>
		<p>ignored me as I walked past, but I could not help but observe his every action with newfound curiousity. His</p>
		<p>method was crude and irregular, and he cut the leaves indiscriminately. He had no regard for the lush green</p>
		<p>innocent leaves and their important function. Yet the hedge was turning out to be neatly cut, as if done by a</p>
		<p>seasoned professional. The tiny pieces of green gently fell onto the dry, hard ground, disguising the water</p>
		<p>deprived state of the land. It seemed that Nature was desperately trying to maintain its beauty.</p>
		<p>Leaves position themselves in such a way that maximum photosynthesis takes place. In an attempt to make</p>
		<p>the hedge look aesthetically beautiful, the gardener disturbed this arrangement. All for the sake of visual</p>
		<p>appeal. What is the point of emphasising on visual appeal or outward appearances if we sacrifice an integral</p>
		<p>part of ourselves in the process and lose our sanctity?</p>
