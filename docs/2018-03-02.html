		<h1>Place In Our Heart [dark twist]</h1><br/>
		<p>i’ve been to hell</p>
		<p>my own hell</p>
		<p>that place in our hearts</p>
		<p>hidden from everyone including ourselves</p>
		<p>where naked truths run free</p>
		<p>love and hate</p>
		<p>virtue and vice</p>
		<p>pain and pleasure</p>
		<p>all merge into one</p>
		<p>i’ve been there</p>
		<p>my very own graveyard</p>
		<p>a land of insecurities</p>
		<p>an endless waterfall falling into the blackness</p>
		<p>a constant buzzing in my ears</p>
		<p>when insanity closes in, there is no escaping yourself</p>
