I have been programming for fun and professionally for 8 years.

I have built static sites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and worked on moderately complex web portals (TypeScript, React, Redux, Router, Material UI, Node, PostgreSQL, Redis).

I have been a solo developer and worked in a team settings. I am product focused with a research based mindset. My interests lie at the intersection of technology and economic development.

I will be finishing my studies at the University of Toronto in August 2023. I am looking for full time roles in business and technology including but not limited to software engineering, data analysis and business analysis/development. I am open to work in India and Canada.
