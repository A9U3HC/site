I have been programming for fun and professionally for 8 years. I learnt [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) by accident in grade 8. My interests lie in the [union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)) of technology and economic development.

I have built static sites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and worked on moderately complex web applications (TypeScript, React, Redux, Material UI, PostgreSQL, Redis). I have been a solo developer and worked in team settings.

I maintain a couple [open source projects](https://github.com/tharatau) where I learnt DevOps best practices (CICD, GitHub Actions) and how to actually use [`git rebase`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing).

I am finishing my studies at the University of Toronto in August 2023 on the lookout for roles in business and technology. This includes but is not limited to software development, data analysis and business analysis/development in India or Canada.

Outside of programming, I like to [read historical fiction/non-fiction](https://goodreads.com/ayushmxn), play basketball and walk by dogs (3 German shepherds).
