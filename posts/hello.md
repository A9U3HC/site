I have been programming for fun and professionally for 8 years. My interests lie
at the union of technology and economic development.

I have built static sites (PHP, JQuery) and worked on moderately complex web
applications (React, Redux, Material UI, PostgreSQL, Redis). I have experience
across web (TypeScript, Angular), mobile (NativeScript, Kotlin, Swift) and
desktop (NW.js, C, C++) application development.

I maintain a couple [open source projects](https://github.com/ayushmanchhabra)
and am an active member of the
[NW Utils community](https://github.com/nwutils/).

Outside of programming, I like to
[read historical fiction/non-fiction](https://goodreads.com/ayushmanchhabra),
play basketball and walk my dogs (3 German shepherds).

I am finishing my studies at the University of Toronto in August 2023 on the
lookout for roles in business and technology in India or Canada.
