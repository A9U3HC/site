# Site

Johnathan Blow's [ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko) really resonated with me. So I set out to create my own blog using CSS, HTML, JavaScript and Markdown (_and_ Node for development).

## Constraints/Goals/Ideas

- CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, Markdown
- No third party modules.
- If a Markdown feature is not used at all, don't support it.

## Changelog

### 2023-10-29

- MD: Add support `#` and regular text.
