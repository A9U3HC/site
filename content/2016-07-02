Visual Appeal

While I was walking down my lane towards my house, I saw a gardener cutting the leaves of a hedge. He
ignored me as I walked past, but I could not help but observe his every action with newfound curiousity. His
method was crude and irregular, and he cut the leaves indiscriminately. He had no regard for the lush green
innocent leaves and their important function. Yet the hedge was turning out to be neatly cut, as if done by a
seasoned professional. The tiny pieces of green gently fell onto the dry, hard ground, disguising the water
deprived state of the land. It seemed that Nature was desperately trying to maintain its beauty.
Leaves position themselves in such a way that maximum photosynthesis takes place. In an attempt to make
the hedge look aesthetically beautiful, the gardener disturbed this arrangement. All for the sake of visual
appeal. What is the point of emphasising on visual appeal or outward appearances if we sacrifice an integral
part of ourselves in the process and lose our sanctity?
