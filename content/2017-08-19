Hoping To Get By


the future is beautifully broken
Fate is drinking wine
we're dreamin'
we're fallin'
we're crawlin'
we're just hopin’ to get by

the dreams they sometimes crumble
the path is not always right
we can be more
we can be less
that's for us to decide

every step I'm takin'
every heart thats breakin'
sorrow has been too kind
the world's turnin'
hearts are beatin'
we're alive
we're alive

we're runnin’
we're stumblin'
we're fallin'
we're just hopin’ to get by

don't fly too high
in this dogfight
you'll get shot down
it'll take your life
I'm comin'
you're coming'
we're comin'
we're all comin' home tonight

oh … we're runnin’
we're stumblin'
we're fallin'
we're just hopin’ to get by

i got this feeling
like its the end of the world
like empty pockets of the poor
like hunger feeding off our hope
its the end of the world and there's nowhere to run
hope has drowned in the tsunami to come

let's return to our homes and wait for the end
wait for the people to take one last breath
wait for the television to be left unattended
wait for the Man to come and take us away
and that’s the end of my world

foolish me
foolish you
you took me seriously
you took my words to be true
it was just a feeling and not the end of the world
i was just trying, hoping to get by.

we're runnin’
we're stumblin'
we're fallin'
we're just hopin’ to get by
