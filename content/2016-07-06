Zephyr

A cool breeze:
respiteful, delightful.
He stands still
for a few precious seconds,
basking in the scorching heat.
Forgetting his pains,
the countless sacrifices made,
his hunger pangs fade.
His weak body,
blistering and red.
He listens to the sound of the wind,
calling to him, whispering.
The message is clear,
he knows what has to be done.
Anticipation and fear collide,
he is ready,
its either fight or die.
