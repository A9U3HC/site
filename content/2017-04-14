More Than A Dream Less Than A Reality

I dreamt of wisps of grey dancing in the morning sun,
the rustle of restless trees, swaying,
the soft, moist earth waiting to be home to withered leaves,
the crunch of naked, excited footsteps on this forlorn, forgotten path,
leading onto a blue infinity.
It was me,
I was walking further and further away,
towards the sea, away from land.
I undressed myself, and
as I was about to jump in,
I halted when the water sizzled white coming in contact with my feet.
A comforting, yellow warmth peaked out of the clouds,
and when I looked down at the distorted, construed reflections,
a tumultuous sound escaped my mouth.
I realised I was truly lost,
I always had been.
