# Design

I was inspired by Johnathan Blow's [ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko) to create a website using just CSS, HTML, JavaScript and Markdown (_and_ Node for local development).

## Requirements

- No third party modules.
- If a feature is not used, do not try supporting it.
- If a feature is no longer used/does not need to be used, remove it.
