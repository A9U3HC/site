Place In Our Heart [dark twist]

i’ve been to hell
my own hell
that place in our hearts
hidden from everyone including ourselves
where naked truths run free
love and hate
virtue and vice
pain and pleasure
all merge into one
i’ve been there
my very own graveyard
a land of insecurities
an endless waterfall falling into the blackness
a constant buzzing in my ears
when insanity closes in, there is no escaping yourself
