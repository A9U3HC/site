FITNESS

Thesis: There is a strong connection between what you think, how you feel and what you do. Every person has different goals, strength level, mobility and upbringing which makes their fitness journey unique.

My Journey: I am a 6"2 North Indian with a large and heavy frame. It is 2024 and I am currently 95kgs with a decent muscular foundation. In 2018 I was 100 kgs and overweight. In 2021 I was 75 kgs and underweight. Over the years I have learnt how to burn fat and how to gain muscle.

Resources: That have helped me the most.
