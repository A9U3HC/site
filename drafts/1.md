# expressing emotion via creativity

I used to write poetry because when I read some poetry it would hit a chord within me. I wanted to write so I could replicate that Aha moment through my writing.

I gradually stopped creative writing (for reasons unknown to me) and started programming more.

Maybe I felt that there was a higher upside to coding than writing.
