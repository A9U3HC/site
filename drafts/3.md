# Maintaining oss without tests

- works for small project with small scope
- but once feature set grow, need tests to validate that addition of Feature B did not break Feature A.
- You can get away with not writing tests. But you will reach a point where you will eventually have to - which is good news.
- The creation phase is characterised by moving fast. You reach a point where moving fast leads to diminishing and mostly negative returns. The only two options are refactor or add tests.
