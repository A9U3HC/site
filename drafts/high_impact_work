HIGH IMPACT WORK

Choosing to do certain low importance tasks which unblock you in the short term will allow you to do high impact work in the long term.

Example 1: Household

Keep your shoes in the same place every time you remove them. Don't waste your time looking for shoes just because you can't remember where you kept them.

Example 2: Software

Write that integration test. What if you encounter and fix a bug which breaks your existing login flow. Don't keep fixing the same bug in the future. Write those tests.
