more

i paused just for a moment
not even a second
my attention deviated from the mundane television show
to the constant low drum of rain drops falling on the roof
and i thought
i want to do something
more
learn something more
for me
not for them
she rested her face on my shoulder
and we shared a moment
as we stretched our bodies
at the same time
she pulled closer to me and fell asleep
i want more
