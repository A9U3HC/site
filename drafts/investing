Why is there no attention by retail investors toward 3D printers? is it because it costs too much? What if you brough down the price over time? That would work if there are people who actually want it and price is acting as a natural barrier to entry. How do you bring down the cost of metal? Since these custom parts use up a lot of materials.  Increase the market supply so its more readilly available. But that harms the environment. How will governments tackle that? They could just keep increasing the taxes. But lobbying will make the rate go up slow.
